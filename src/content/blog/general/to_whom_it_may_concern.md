i miss you a little more today,<br>
the space you left feels grey.

your reels, your toks, your tweets,<br>
they were chaos in my feeds, but i looked forward to the beat.

now the noise is gone, the silence is clear,<br>
and in the quiet, i’m missing you here.

do you miss me too, just a little bit?<br>
maybe in the stillness, you can’t help but think of it.
