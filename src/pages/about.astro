    <h1 class="text-title text-5xl font-bold">Hi, Welcome!</h1>

      I am a last-year undergraduate student majoring in Informatics at Telkom
      University, currently working on my final thesis. My current interest lies
      in Backend Engineering/Development, but I am also passionate about
      learning and exploring various fields in software engineering such as
      system engineering, frontend, DevOps, competitive programming, and more.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained experience
      with a variety of technologies including (but not limited to):
      <span class="font-semibold"
        >Linux, C++, SQL, Java, Python, Flask, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis,
        NodeJS, Golang, Laravel, GCP, Nix, Notion, and Nginx</span
      >.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Beyond my technical pursuits, I enjoy movies, music, playing guitar,
      gaming (mostly Valorant, FIFA, or Mobile Legends, recently Chivalry 2)
      feel free to hit my DMs if you want to play together üòÅ, and tinkering
      around with my day-to-day work environment. Feel free to explore around to
      learn more about my work, projects, and interests.
